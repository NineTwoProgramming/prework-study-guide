# Prework Study Guide

## Description

The struggle that I encountered early on in the prework made me realize that there may be other people who are also struggling. This has lead me to create a study guide to help both new and current students that are having a difficult time with the content. 

This application was created to help students that are/were going through the bootcamp Prework. It provides notes on the different subjects taught during the bootcamp Prework and the students will have sufficient information moving forward. 

By creating this application, I was able to solidify my learning and push forth what I know to help others.

## Installation

## Usage

You can review the notes in each section to better understand what was taught during the bootcamp prework. For a suggestion on what to study first, you can open up the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows).

The console should open and there will be a list of topics that we learned during the prework. It is followed by a suggestion if you are unsure on what to study first.
